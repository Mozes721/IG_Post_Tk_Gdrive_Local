# IG_Tk_Gdrive

The project is to post on  IG using Tkinter(GUI).
You get prompted prior on terminal if you want to get the image from local storage or GDrive.
When image is chosen the Tkinter GUI apears with choosen image.
Write the coresponding text to the image and then using the instabot library post it on the IG.

We recommend to use `virtualenv` for development:

- Start by installing `virtualenv` if you don't have it
```
pip install virtualenv
```

- Once installed access the project folder
```
cd IG_Tk_Gdrive
```

- Create a virtual environment
```
virtualenv venv
```

- Enable the virtual environment
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the python required on the virtual environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
